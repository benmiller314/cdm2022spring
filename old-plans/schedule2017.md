Intro to second half of semester
in-class writing: brainstorm possible projects for the collaborative unit
what is html? why *markup*?
[CSS Zen Garden](http://www.csszengarden.com/)
[Web design in 4 minutes](http://jgthms.com/web-design-in-4-minutes/)
Using your browser's Developer Tools
* in MS Edge: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/f12-devtools-guide
* in Chrome: etc

NOTES FOR NEXT YEAR: Change title of lesson-13 to be about reflecting on the first half of the semester, setting goals for the second half, as part of the collaborative unit: what skills did you come here to learn that aren't on the syllabus? what project might require you to use those skills?

Shuffle a lot of this schedule. Start internetingishard tutorial for hw after this first web day, introduce browser inspection more fully in the second web day, and model the multimodal analysis; then do the multimodal analysis as homework after the second web day in prep for developing criteria in the third web day. then workshop on the fourth web day.

-->
For next time:

* (Re)read chapters 2 and 3 of *Writer/Designer*, on "Analyzing Multimodal Projects" and "Choosing a Genre and Pitching Your Project," respectively.
* Do the Process! activity on page 37: "Analyzing a Web Site's Design Choices."

For next time:

* Continue reading and following along with the tutorial disproving the claim that ["html & css is hard"](https://internetingishard.com/html-and-css/). Spend at least an hour, aiming to learn something you don't already know.
 - If this is *all* familiar, including responsive design, read up on accessibility and "universal" design, starting here: [Introduction to Web Accessibility](https://webaim.org/intro/).
* Once you know what `<img>` tags are, review this guidance on how and why to include the alt attribute in all of your `<img>` tags: [webaim.org/techniques/alttext/](https://webaim.org/techniques/alttext/)
* If you haven't yet, sign up for a midterm conference with Ben over the next two weeks (absolute latest deadline: 11/9)
