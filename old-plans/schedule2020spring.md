*In this unit, you will make a claim through the juxtaposition of images and text. As with the sound project, the context for your argument is open: you could be making a social commentary, calling for action, constructing a parody, riffing on a pun, explaining a concept, and so on.

-->
For next time:

* **Do** as much of the [Interneting is Hard (but it doesn't have to be)](https://internetingishard.com/html-and-css/) tutorial as you can – but **at least parts 1-4** (from "Introduction" through "Hello, CSS")

<div class="alert alert-warning">
Spring break is the week of Tu 3/10 and Th 3/12; our only classes will be CSS classes.

<div class="alert alert-danger">
<p><i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle"></i> Well! This COVID19 thing is going to be an adventure, isn't it! Classes are canceled outright for Tu 3/17 and Th 3/19, and moving online for the four weeks remaining beyond that. The schedule below is now updated, accordingly, and I'll adjust the lesson plans for a distant-learning format. (Mostly, they'll be plans for self-timed composing, but still set for the same calendar day.) </p>

<p>I'm also shifting my office hours online, and reserving class-time as additional office hours; see <a href="http://benmiller314.youcanbook.me">http://benmiller314.youcanbook.me</a> for the Zoom link and advanced reservations (which aren't required).</p>

<h3><a href="{{site.github_url}}/plans/lesson-19">Lesson 19, Tuesday <del>3/17</del>3/24</a> – Studio and Final Unit Planning</h3>

For next time:

<!-- * **Write** (or respond to) a pitch toward the collaborative project
-->
* **Compose and push** a full draft of your website project no later than Thursday morning (let's say 10am Eastern).
* To test that it's fully on GitHub, **clone it again to a new location** on your computer: if you can successfully open your pages in a local browser from that second location, you should be good to get feedback in Thursday's asynchronous workshop! <em>(And you should then also be good to **delete that extra copy**, before you get confused as to where you're pushing from.)</em>

<h3><a href="{{site.github_url}}/plans/lesson-20">Lesson 20, Thursday <del>3/19</del>3/26</a> – Web Unit Workshop</h3>
<!-- Recommend this talking timer: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/talking-timer-custom-spea/cbbmoeglgokhkbnnfpoeciheapicdphm?hl=en -->
<div class="alert alert-warning">
<del><strong>Our class WILL NOT MEET on Thursday, 3/26</strong>: I will be out of town for the Conference on College Composition and Communication.</del> With my out-of-town conference and most other travel plans canceled, and with two classes vaporized, I'm hoping many of you will be available to "meet" on Thursday, 3/26, even though we weren't originally going to. This will allow us to keep our workshop in its original place in the workflow. <strong>If you won't be able to clone and comment on peers' websites-in-progress, please let me know asap</strong> so we can make other arrangements for feedback!
</div>


For next time:

* **By 11:59pm on Tuesday,** complete – at least for now – your website project.
* **By Thursday** write a prose reflection that incorporates images from your feedback and screenshots of your work in progress.

<h3><a href="{{site.github_url}}/plans/lesson-21">Lesson 21, Tuesday <del>3/24</del>3/31</a> – Studio</h3>

For next time:
* **By 11:59pm tonight,** complete – at least for now – your website project.
* **By Thursday,** write a prose reflection that incorporates images from your feedback and screenshots of your work in progress.
* <del>Then take the weekend to read through the proposals so far for group projects: what seems both exciting and achievable?</del>


<h2 id="unit-5">Unit V: <del>Collaborative Composing</del> Putting it Together (Bit by Bit)<a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/44Ngw7iHXXuSfzxgAb2cuf?si=OctGE9JRTbeP8iNpiKVA9w"><span class="hidden">*</span>*</a></h2>

<div class="alert alert-warning">
<p>I'm getting the sense that enforced collaboration is <em>not</em> the best way forward when we can't reliably meet and look at things together. Instead, in this unit I'll ask you to build on what you've already made: a revision, an extension, or a combination, of the modes and media you used in earlier units. If you have a team that can collaborate effectively via online formats (via Zoom, Discord, Slack, what-have-you), that's up to you!</p>

<p>If you're feeling especially aspirational, might I suggest that a game or interactive story built in <a href="https://twinery.org">Twine</a> might serve that combinatory goal quite well? I'll see what I'm able to screen-record by way of introduction / guidance.</p>
</div>

<h3><del>Lesson 22, Tuesday 3/31 – Intro to Collaborative Unit: Charting a Course Forward</del></h3>

<h3><a href="{{site.github_url}}/plans/lesson-22">Lesson 22, Thursday 4/2</a> – Intro to Consolidation Unit: Charting a Course Forward</h3>

<!-- In lesson plan, include this:
* Some Twine games to play (including student projects), initially presented as a reward for finishing the web project
* Some kind of reflective/generative writing
* If you're interested in Twine, skim through [the Twine 2 wiki](http://twinery.org/wiki/twine2:guide).
  - Important note for you Twinerers: you can reverse engineer an existing Twine! Just right-click to "view source," save that page, import the html into your Twine app, and you should be able to see what it's made of. : )
-->

For next time:
* Make a new repository (GH, Box, or Drive) containing a task list for your project – along with proposed roles for your team members, if you have a team of more than one.
  - If you're updating an existing project, do this in a new branch of the old repository, instead.
* Post a link to this repository on the [Issue Queue]({{site.github.issues_url}}).
* Decide (together, if applicable) what would constitute a minimum deliverable project, and what series of stretch goals you'll try for beyond that minimum. Push these updated goals to the repo.

<h3><a href="{{site.github_url}}/plans/lesson-23">Lesson 23, <del>Thursday 4/2</del> Tuesday 4/7</a> – Consolidation Unit Studio</h3>

For next time:
* Push a project preview (i.e. get something started) to your repository.
* Continue updating and following your group plan.
* Document your progress as you go! Screenshot, save, commit (or otherwise log changes), push.

* Full-as-possible draft of consolidation project

<h3><a href="{{site.github_url}}/plans/lesson-25">Lesson 25, <del>Thursday 4/9</del> Tuesday 4/14</a> – Workshop</h3>

For next time:
* Set yourself some deadlines: what are you trying to finish by the last class (in two days!)? Will you continue beyond that for Sunday, knowing the final portfolio is due on Tuesday 4/21?
* **Read** Paul Ford's "Letter of Recommendation: Bug Fixes" from <em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/11/magazine/letter-of-recommendation-bug-fixes-git.html">The New York Times Magazine</a></em> (June 11, 2019). ([Pitt Library link](http://pitt.idm.oclc.org/login?url=https://search-proquest-com.pitt.idm.oclc.org/docview/2237787684))
* Ford writes, "I read the change logs, and I think: <em>Humans can do things.</em>" **Read back** through your own change logs, i.e. the commit histories of your projects; skim through the lesson plans. What things have you done this semester?
* **Choose** something from the course that you want to remember beyond this semester: a thing you or someone else made, or said, that struck a chord with you.

<h2 id="unit-6">Unit VI: Reflection and Revision</h2>

_Before the semester ends, I'd wanted to set aside time to work on drafting a reflective introduction to your final portfolio. With the lost week, that ends up being... one day. Sigh. Given self-pacing, some of you may end up here sooner...?_

<h3><a href="{{site.github_url}}/plans/lesson-26">Lesson 26, <del>Tuesday 4/14</del> Thursday 4/16</a> – Last day of class! Looking back and looking forward</h3>

For next time:
* Finish consolidation project by Sunday, if you haven't yet
* Work to complete your final portfolio (due Tuesday)

<div class="alert alert-success">
<em>Final portfolios will be due by the end of the final exam slot, which we now know will be <strong>Tuesday, April 21 at 1:50pm</strong>.</em> Grades are due eight days later, so if you want to turn it in earlier (but not before 4/14, I would expect), feel free to do so.
