# Collaborative Studio

**Work to have done**: a preview of your group project, in pursuit of the vision in your proposal

**Plan for the Day**:

1. Baseline goals for collaboration (10 min?)
2. Set goals for today (3-5 min)
3. Studio time!
4. Set deadlines
5. Exit note

## 1. Baseline goals for collaboration (10 min?)

I'd like to see if we can briefly establish some criteria that would work across groups – starting with those strategies for successful group work we brainstormed last time. Let's take notes in the usual google doc: [bit.ly/cdm2019fall-criteria](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NcXvQsBNPaumL6h_7ghKLJbQxPe_ALCiFMtPgaQI0Zk/edit#heading=h.kxpc4jsbvq0i).

<!-- My proposed starting points:
For a minimum grade of B, all projects for this unit must…
* Record somewhere the roles and/or tasks performed by each member of the group
* Document planning strategies from early notes / sketches to revised versions
* Include reflections that honestly celebrate group members’ strengths and contributions
* Collectively include more than one mode of composition (e.g. text, sound, image, code, etc)
-->

## 2. Set goals for today (3-5 min)

Leaving time for the end of class to send me an exit note, what's your goal to have finished by, say, 3:30?

What will each of you be working on first?

How long do you expect it to take?

How often will you check in with each other?

<strong>The Project Manager should document this somewhere.</strong>

## 3. Studio time!

Use the time to enact your roles and move your projects forward.

<div class="alert alert-warning">
Don't forget to save periodically as you go:
 <ul>
   <li>as a screenshot</li>
   <li>as a git commit, saying what you've just achieved</li>
   <li>as a project file or export, whatever's most relevant</li>
 </ul>
</div>

## 4. Set deadlines (5-10 min)

Your individual tasks will be determined within each group, so make sure you <strong>discuss your goals with each other and write them down somewhere.</strong> Are you aiming to complete this by end-of-class on Thursday? By Sunday?

<div class="alert alert-info">
I highly recommend having some minimum deliverable product by Thursday (shall we call it a complete rough draft?), and then setting relatively discrete stretch goals beyond that.
</div>

For what it's worth, I'm hoping we can share the final products of these projects on the last day of class – which is to say, two weeks from Thursday, with no classes next week.

## 6. Exit note (5-10 min)

Before you leave, as a way for me to check in and for your own reflection-ready records, I'd like to hear more about what you, in particular, worked on today. Just a short email, if you don't mind! And thanks!
