# Collaborative Studio

**Work to have done**: a draft of your group project, in pursuit of the vision in your proposal

**Plan for the Day**:

1. Final Portfolio Introduction (10 min)
2. Set goals for today (3-5 min)
3. Studio time!
4. Set deadlines
5. Exit teaser

## 1. Final Portfolio Introduction (10 min)

The final portfolio will consist of a single post on the [issue queue]({{site.github.issues_url}}/) containing:

1.	a **prose reflection** of at least 800-1200 words (1200-1800 recommended), reflecting on the course and framing the portfolio’s contents in terms of your learning and goals;
    * NB: I have a **[handout](https://github.com/benmiller314/cdm2019fall/blob/gh-pages/uploads/handout--final-portfolio-prompt.docx?raw=true)** with guidelines and prompts
2.	**representative thumbnails, hyperlinked to final versions** of your four unit projects, i.e. Soundscape Narrative, Visual Argument, Website, and Collaboration;
3.	**links to your repositories** (on either GitHub or Box) for each of those pieces; and
4.	**a thumbnail of at least one specific prior draft, hyperlinked to that file in the revision history**, allowing you to talk about your revision skills.

In addition to the portfolio, or as preparation for it, I encourage you to retake the [Tech Comfort Survey](http://bit.ly/cdm-tech-survey) from the start of the semester. Among other things, it'll give you a space to officially tell me whether and how I can use your work as an example in future semesters.


What questions do you have about all that?

<!-- NB: There is no separate reflection deadline for the collaborative unit; you can just include that in the final reflection for the semester. -->

## 2. Set goals for today (3-5 min)

Leaving time for the end of class to share a teaser of your project with the full group, what's your goal to have finished by, say, 3:30?

What will each of you be working on first?

How long do you expect it to take?

How often will you check in with each other?

<strong>The Project Manager should document this somewhere.</strong>

A reminder of our [bit.ly/cdm2019fall-criteria](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NcXvQsBNPaumL6h_7ghKLJbQxPe_ALCiFMtPgaQI0Zk/edit#heading=h.kxpc4jsbvq0i).

<!-- My proposed starting points:
For a minimum grade of B, all projects for this unit must…
* Record somewhere the roles and/or tasks performed by each member of the group
* Document planning strategies from early notes / sketches to revised versions
* Include reflections that honestly celebrate group members’ strengths and contributions
* Collectively include more than one mode of composition (e.g. text, sound, image, code, etc)
-->

## 3. Studio time!

Use the time to enact your roles and move your projects forward.

<div class="alert alert-warning">
Don't forget to save periodically as you go:
 <ul>
   <li>as a screenshot</li>
   <li>as a git commit, saying what you've just achieved</li>
   <li>as a project file or export, whatever's most relevant</li>
 </ul>
</div>

## 4. Set deadlines (5-10 min)

Your individual tasks will be determined within each group, so make sure you <strong>discuss your goals with each other and write them down somewhere.</strong> Are you considering this piece done, or did you have a different deadline (Sunday)? Are there stretch goals you'd still like to try for? Who's going to work on what?

## 5. Think about revision
When we get back after Thanksgiving, we'll have just two classes. The first will be a revision-oriented studio, in which you can go back to work on any project you'd like... or to use class time to draft your final reflections.

The Thursday will be a celebration and sharing of your projects.

Which reminds me: there will be a Digital Media Symposium on Friday, December 6, from 12:30pm to 3:00pm, in CL 501. Hope to see you there!


## 6. Exit "note": project teasers (5-10 min)

Usually we share drafts, get feedback, all that good stuff; in this unit, because each group already contains multitudes, I thought we could get away without it. But you have been working kind of isolated from each other, so in lieu of an exit note, **I'd like to ask each group to do a little oral preview of your collaborative project:** just tell us what you've been working on! We should have time to do more in-person playing through of the sites on the last day of class.
