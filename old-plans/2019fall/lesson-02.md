**Writing to turn in:**

* A post to the main course [issue queue]({{site.github.issues_url}}/1), introducing yourself to your classmates (and anyone else who stumbles upon it)


## Plan for the Day

1. Contract questions?
2. Five Principles, in Brief (15 min)
3. GitHub, part 2  <!-- repo, commit, history, diff --> (15 min)
4. Five Principles as Lenses (15 min)


### 1. Contract questions?
Anyone have any questions about the grading contract, or changes to propose?

### 2. Five Principles, in Brief
We have a couple of new students, and also Margaret, our TA. Welcome!

Can I get five people to fill them in on the five "principles of new media" from the article I asked you to read? i.e. One person, one term.

<!-- numerical representation, modularity, automation, variability,
and transcoding -->

<!-- If you had to look them up, would you rather use the webtext or the pdf? Why? -->

### 3. GitHub, part 2
Last time, we saw that GitHub can host a discussion forum, so in that sense it's a community website: it makes media social.

But its core functionality is meant to solve a different media problem:

<div class="alert alert-success">
Let's quickly walk through what it looks like:
<strong><a href="https://github.com/benmiller314/text-demo">https://github.com/benmiller314/text-demo</a></strong>
</div>

<!--
1. Create a new .txt file.
2. Demo the importance of the extension by previewing what happens if it's .md?
3. Commit the new file directly to master.
4. Change the text.
5. Create a new branch, then merge it. Why, you ask?
   It matters when you're working with others: you want to make sure you're comparing
   against the most up-to-date version, so you don't accidentally erase something new.
   This will become important in a minute.
-->

### 4. Five Principles as Lenses

Time to take these abstractions and put them into practice, in two ways:

* practice using GitHub
* practice using our key terms to help us see differently

We'll be working in groups. Can I get about five volunteers who are feeling good about GitHub to anchor those teams for today?

<div class="alert alert-success">
Head to
<strong><a href="https://github.com/pitt-cdm/digital-affordances">https://github.com/pitt-cdm/digital-affordances</a></strong>, where you'll find more instructions for what to do next – starting with forking the repo. (Thanks, anchors!)

Then follow the instructions in the README file.
<!-- FOR NEXT TIME: make a clean copy of the pitt-cdm repo to fork (e.g. make it a template);
then, as an EXT for when they're done making their individual files,
have them file a pull request back to the original. -->
</div>

We'll work for 10-15 minutes, then report back.

## HW for next time:

* **Watch** Git and GitHub for Poets, starting at least with
[the Introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCQHnlnPusY&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6ZF9C0YMKuns9sLDzK6zoiV) and going as far as your interest and time allow.
<!-- FOR NEXT TIME: have them write something on GH, commit, edit it, commit, and view the history. You know, *do* the thing in the video! -->
* **Download** software you'll need, as outlined in the [syllabus](/{{site.course.base_url}}uploads)
 - [to use Git at the command line](https://gist.github.com/derhuerst/1b15ff4652a867391f03), possibly including Homebrew (on Mac) or GitBash (on Windows)
* *Optional:* If you're feeling intimidated by the command line, try out this [Command Line Crash Course](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/appendixa.html)
* *Optional:* Want a more hands-on guide through the full GitHub functionality? See the GitHub Learning Lab entry on our [Resources page](/{{site.course.base_url}}resources).
