# Intro to GIMP and Visual Design

**Work to have achieved**:

* Read about graphic design principles (positive/negative space, dominance & hierarchy, rhythm & movement)
* Find a graphic or visual design that makes a claim or argument
* Analyze the designed artifact through the lenses of graphic design principles.


**Plan for the day**:

1. Building our vocabulary (5-10 min)
2. Using our vocabulary (10-20 min)
3. Introduction to GIMP (15 min)
4. Practice time (30-45 min)


## 1. Building our vocabulary (5-10 min)

A bunch of new terms! Let's try to annotate these – just a few key words each - so we know we're on the same page. Head on over to [bit.ly/cdm2019fall](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NcXvQsBNPaumL6h_7ghKLJbQxPe_ALCiFMtPgaQI0Zk/edit#heading=h.fhi9jgmnxpx8) and jump down to "Keywords toward a Visual Rhetoric."

* Visual Dominance <!-- what draws the eye? -->
   - Scale <!-- big -->
   - Value <!-- dark/intense -->
   - Color <!-- contrast -->
   - Style <!-- contrast -->
   - Proximity <!-- isolation -->
   - Density <!-- contrast -->
* Visual Rhythm
   - Repetition <!-- establish unity -->
   - Pattern <!-- establish backdrop for contrast -->
   - Flow <!-- variation set against similarities; use of line -->
* Positive and negative space

## 2. Using our vocabulary (10-20 min)
Let's look at some strong examples of design from the forum, to get a better handle on how they're making an argument through visuals.

Possibilities:
* [Home away from home](https://github.com/benmiller314/cdm2019fall/issues/7#issuecomment-535334494), posted by Kevin
* [Save water](https://github.com/benmiller314/cdm2019fall/issues/7#issuecomment-535352493), posted by Brittany
* [Thanksgiving](https://github.com/benmiller314/cdm2019fall/issues/7#issuecomment-535585694), posted by Natasha

For each, ask:
1. What does this image want us to do or realize?
2. What arguments is it making?
3. How does the design function in terms of...
   - _positive and negative space_: Is the negative space significant here?
   - _dominance and hierarchy_: What has the most visual weight? Second-most? Is there a third level? Beyond? Is there a unity of design?
   - _rhythm and movement_: How does your eye move across the image? Does it come to rest, or keep moving? Why?
4. Would you say the artifact is effectively designed for making the arguments we've identified?

## 3. Introduction to GIMP (15 min)

I'll demo, using "Fly Me to the Moon, by Way of a Hot Air Balloon" (2009) by [Beverly & Pack](https://www.flickr.com/photos/walkadog/), [on Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/walkadog/3897126692/). [CC-BY-2.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/).

Points to hit:
* Single window mode
* Lots of selection tools
   - Quick Mask to help see what's currently selected
* Pay attention to the tiny text at the bottom: `shift`, `control`, `alt` can modify how the tool works.
* Extracting objects from background.
* Paste Layers. <!--Inverse select-->
* Layers! Of course layers
* Clone tool; tool settings window
* Scale layer, and why it's often one-directional. (Rasters vs. vectors.)

## 4. Practice time (30-45 min)

**Option 1:** take your profile image and an alternative background you find online (use that fair-use search tool) to put yourself in a new location.

**Option 2:** take the image you found for homework and alter it to get a better understanding of how its parts add up to a greater whole.

# Homework for next time  :

* **Read** about fonts at [https://www.canva.com/learn/font-design/](https://www.canva.com/learn/font-design/).
   - Optionally, **play** a font-matching game at http://www.typeconnection.com/ to get a sense of (a) what sorts of fonts are out there and (b) how designers go about pairing fonts for what Thompson (in the reading for today) called hierarchy by "style."
* **Choose** at least two tutorials from [gimp.org/tutorials](https://gimp.org/tutorials), **and practice** what they teach. For beginners, GIMP Quickies and Simple Floating Logo are probably good places to start; Layer Masks is probably intermediate; and you can get quite advanced as you scroll down the page.
* **Review** the [resources page]({{site.github_url}}/resources), this time with an eye toward visual resources. As before, note that there are sections both for finding images and for getting help thinking visually – and, as before, feel free to suggest additional resources if you have any!
