*In this unit, you will make a claim through the juxtaposition of images and text. As with the sound project, the context for your argument is open: you could be making a social commentary, calling for action, constructing a parody, riffing on a pun, explaining a concept, and so on. Whatever you choose, you should consider your audience and what they would find persuasive or interesting, and how you therefore wish to attract and direct their attention.*

<h3><a href="{{site.github_url}}/plans/lesson-17">Lesson 17, Thursday 10/15</a> – Intro to Markup and Web Design</h3>
<!--
See also lesson outline in old-plans/2019fall/lesson-17.md.

 <h3><a href="{{site.github_url}}/plans/lesson-19">Lesson 19, Thursday 10/22</a> – Web Unit Studio / Deployment</h3>

<!--
NEW AFTER 2020fall: make sure everyone knows how to make a navigation menu using <nav><ul><li><a> ... and to resize the <a> directly using padding. Point out that this is a direct application of the Box Model.
Make sure everyone has successfully activated GitHub Pages before they leave. Note that the instructions at  https://pages.github.com/ are confusing, because we *don't want to create a whole new repo.* -->

For next time:

* **Do** more of the [tutorial](https://internetingishard.com/html-and-css/), including at least Flexbox (8) and Responsive Design (10), if you haven't yet.

* As a reminder, you should **do the exercises in the tutorials** and push them to your repository – possibly in a subfolder.
* A _preview_ isn't due for another week, but you're welcome to begin assembling your website before then if you have ideas. That'll just give you more time to debug and refine!

<h3><a href="{{site.github_url}}/plans/lesson-20">Lesson 20, Tuesday 10/27</a> – Web Unit Studio / Layout Q & A</h3>
<!--
Self-paced tutorialing
Offline sketching
-->
For next time:

* **Compose and push** a website preview: a beginning of your own site.
  - A full draft of your website project is due in one week, when we'll have workshop.
* **Finish** the [tutorial](https://internetingishard.com/html-and-css/), if you haven't yet – or revisit the sections that are still confusing. I especially encourage you to look at sections 12 ([Semantic HTML](https://www.internetingishard.com/html-and-css/semantic-html/)) and 14 ([Web Typography](https://www.internetingishard.com/html-and-css/web-typography/)), and if you're having trouble with positioning even after working through Flexbox (section 8) and Grid (on Medium), try section 9 ([Advanced Positioning](https://www.internetingishard.com/html-and-css/advanced-positioning/)).
  - Email me with any questions, noting that I can help fastest if you include a screenshot and a link. Better yet, [create a New Issue](https://github.com/benmiller314/cdm2020fall/issues/new/choose)! Then my answer to you can help others, too.


<h3><a href="{{site.github_url}}/plans/lesson-21">Lesson 21, Thursday 10/29</a> – Criteria and Stretch Goals</h3>

For next time:

<!-- * **Write** (or respond to) a pitch toward the collaborative project
-->
* **Compose and push** a full draft of your website project no later than Tuesday morning (let's say 10am Eastern).
* When it's ready, to test that it's fully on GitHub, **clone it again to a new location** on your computer: if you can successfully open your pages in a local browser from that second location, you should be good to get feedback even from an asynchronous workshop. <em>(And you should then also be good to **delete that extra copy**, before you get confused as to where you're pushing from.)</em>

<h3><a href="{{site.github_url}}/plans/lesson-22">Lesson 22, Tuesday 11/3</a> – Web Unit Workshop </h3>

<div class="alert alert-danger">
UPDATE: To give everyone the flexibility to go to the polls, this will be a <strong>fully asynchronous</strong> workshop. See lesson plan for details.
</div>

For next time:
* **Write** one more blog post about what you'd like to do in our final / integrative unit. If you're interested in finding people to collaborate with, this is a good time to make a pitch.
  - Post this to <a href="{{site.github.issues_url}}">the issue queue</a>, as usual
* Continue to **save and push** toward your final-for-now website.
* If you're workshopping asynchronously, be sure to finish leaving your comments by Thursday, so your partners have time to revise.


* **By 11:59pm next Sunday (11/8),** complete – at least for now – your website project.
* **By next Tuesday's class,** write a prose reflection that incorporates images from your feedback and screenshots of your work in progress.

<h3><a href="{{site.github_url}}/plans/lesson-23">Lesson 23, Thursday 11/5</a> – Studio</h3>

For next time:
* **By Sunday,** aim to complete – at least for now – your website project. That'll give you more time to reflect.
* **By Tuesday,** write a prose reflection that incorporates images from your feedback and screenshots of your work in progress.
<!-- * If you finish early, head over to <a href="{{site.github.issues_url}}">the issue queue</a> and read through final-unit proposals. Anything you want to collaborate on? (Collaboration is not required for the final unit.) -->

<h2 id="unit-5">Unit V: Putting it Together (Bit by Bit)<a href="https://youtu.be/rJFz-ucuTvs?t=328"><span class="hidden">*</span>*</a></h2>

*In this final unit I'll ask you to build on what you've already made: a revision, an extension, or a combination, of the modes and media you used in earlier units. If you have a team that can collaborate effectively via online formats (via Zoom, Discord, Slack, what-have-you), that's up to you! Please do let me know if you want to be in a break-out group together during class.*

<!-- <p>If you're feeling especially aspirational, might I suggest that a game or interactive story built in <a href="https://twinery.org">Twine</a> might serve that combinatory goal quite well? I'll see what I'm able to screen-record by way of introduction / guidance.</p> -->


<h3><a href="{{site.github_url}}/plans/lesson-24">Lesson 24, Tuesday 11/10</a> – Intro to Consolidation / Integration Unit: Charting a Course Forward</h3>


<!-- In lesson plan, include this:
* Some Twine games to play (including student projects), initially presented as a reward for finishing the web project
* Some kind of reflective/generative writing
* If you're interested in Twine, skim through [the Twine 2 wiki](http://twinery.org/wiki/twine2:guide).
  - Important note for you Twinerers: you can reverse engineer an existing Twine! Just right-click to "view source," save that page, import the html into your Twine app, and you should be able to see what it's made of. : )
-->

For next time:
* *Preparing for the final portfolio:*
  * **Read** Paul Ford's "Letter of Recommendation: Bug Fixes" from <em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/11/magazine/letter-of-recommendation-bug-fixes-git.html">The New York Times Magazine</a></em> (June 11, 2019). ([Pitt Library link](http://pitt.idm.oclc.org/login?url=https://search-proquest-com.pitt.idm.oclc.org/docview/2237787684))
  * Ford writes, "I read the change logs, and I think: <em>Humans can do things.</em>" **Read back** through your own change logs, i.e. the commit histories of your projects; skim through the lesson plans. What things have you done this semester?
  * **Choose** something from the course that you want to remember beyond this semester: a thing you or someone else made, or said, that struck a chord with you.
* *Preparing one final project or revision:*
  * Make a new repository<sup>*</sup> (GH, Box, or Drive) containing a task list for your project – along with proposed roles for your team members, if you have a team of more than one.
    - <sup>*</sup> If you're updating an existing project, I recommend doing this in a [new branch](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/managing-branches) of the old repository, instead.
    - Post a link to this repository on the [Issue Queue]({{site.github.issues_url}}).
    - Decide (together, if applicable) what would constitute a minimum deliverable project, and what series of stretch goals you'll try for beyond that minimum. Push these updated goals to the repo.

<h3><a href="{{site.github_url}}/plans/lesson-25">Lesson 25, Thursday 11/12</a> – Intro to Final Portfolio, Consolidation Unit Studio</h3>

For next time:
* **Push** a project preview (i.e. get something started) to your repository.
* Continue updating and following your work plan.
* **Document your progress** as you go! Screenshot, save, commit (or otherwise log changes), push.

<h3><a href="{{site.github_url}}/plans/lesson-26">Lesson 26, Tuesday 11/17</a> – Consolidation Unit Criteria (But Mostly Studio)</h3>
