## 5. Audacity Tour, by way of a past-semester example (10-15 min) <!-- tracks, mute/solo, label, resize tracks, zoom -->

I want to start with a behind-the-scenes view of one of the finished soundscapes I'll ask you to listen to for homework.

This is Tyller Barner's "Coffeeshop Conversations," from Spring 2019. I'm very happy to talk at some point about the piece itself, but for now, let's see what it can show us about this new application, Audacity.

### Initial questions to ask of any app:

- How is the space laid out?
- What's given the most prominent visual focus? Secondary focus?
- What features/tools do you have quick access to?

### Now let's play

<!--
1. Literally press play.
2. Zoom far in.
3. Pin the cursor.
4. Scroll up and down.
5. Zoom all the way out in one click.
6. View > Track Size > Collapse tracks.
7. Try to move "Hillman Coffee" track to the bottom. Can't do it without stopping!
8. Stop. Move the track. Hit play again. Where does it start?
9. Try muting the background noise.
10. Try muting the music track.
11. Rename the music track.
12. Revisit the questions above.

### Project files vs. rendered files

<!-- show Tyller's files -->

Audacity project files, with extension .aup3, are not playable in any program other than Audacity. Strictly speaking, they're not actually sound files: they're a database *of* a large number of sound files, bundled together with the files themselves, plus information about track display sizes, whether they're muted, how much they're panned left or right, and so on.

(In fact, until Audacity 3.x, all these files and the index of metadata used to be separate. It's a mixed bag that they're not any more: on the one hand, it's harder to mess up. On the other, it makes that unified file a lot larger.)

To make the file playable, you have to *render* it by using File > Export As. You're probably fine to use .mp3 format for most purposes.

<div class="alert alert-warning">
NB: You probably <em>don't</em> want to use .wav files most of the time: they're lossless, but they're uncompressed, and therefore tend to eat up huge quantities of disk space.

* The main writing assignment for the week is to <strong>post a proposal for your soundscape narrative by Tuesday</strong>, including a preliminary chart of sound assets you might want to include.
  - To encourage cross-pollination, I'd like you to post these to the [issue queue]({{site.github.issues_url}}).
  - If you're feeling stuck on what to propose, see the <a title="Because you reach for them when you feel like you're falling">"parachute prompts"</a> at the bottom of the [project assignment](https://github.com/benmiller314/soundscape{{site.course.slugterm}}#parachute-prompts).

* The term "asset" comes from a reading assignment from the book _Writer/Designer_ (Ball, Sheppard, and Arola, eds). A scan of the relevant chapter is <a title="not posted to preserve the limited distribution that helps justify my fair use claim (as does my colorless copy and the limited amount copied, relative to the book)" href="{{site.canvas_url}}/assignments/849366">posted to the Perusall social annotation software on Canvas</a>; **please read it before writing your proposal.**
   - _Optionally_, you can also read through a [short four-page webcomic](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Howitworks_Comic1) explaining how Creative Commons (CC) licenses get attached to copyrightable materials, and how easily CC materials can be included and/or remixed in further creations... with, at a minimum, attribution. The subject is covered in _Writer/Designer_, but the comic is cute.
    - _Even more optionally_, you can **read** the Stanford Overview of Fair Use, which you can find in a series of four webpages beginning at [fairuse.stanford.edu/overview/fair-use/](https://fairuse.stanford.edu/overview/fair-use/). This text, despite being called an overview, is really a more in-depth understanding of fair use than the brief introduction in _Writer/Designer_. If Ball et al. struck a chord with you, here's where to read on!

* Finally, I'd like you to **read** the following advice on sound recording, **listening to the embedded clips**:
     - Fowkes, Stuart. “The Top 5 Things You Need to Make a Great Field Recording.” *Cities & Memory: Field Recordings, Sound Map, Sound Art*, 13 Aug. 2014, [https://citiesandmemory.com/2014/08/top-5-things-need-make-great-field-recording/](https://citiesandmemory.com/2014/08/top-5-things-need-make-great-field-recording/).
     - MacAdam, Alison. “6 NPR Stories That Breathe Life into Neighborhood Scenes.” *NPR Training*, 30 Oct. 2015, [https://training.npr.org/audio/six-npr-stories-that-breathe-life-into-neighborhood-scenes/](https://training.npr.org/audio/six-npr-stories-that-breathe-life-into-neighborhood-scenes/). (**Note the time skips she recommends**: sometimes a long clip is embedded, but not meant to be listened to in full.)

* PS: Have you seen our plentiful <a href="{{site.github_url}}/resources">Resources</a> page? Be sure to at least skim both the free/licensed sounds and music section and the audio-unit-specific advice and examples.
